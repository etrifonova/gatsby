Adam Gontier is an outstanding rock singer, previously for Three Days Grace and currently for Saint Asonia. He sometimes performs solo.

Adam has an incredibly powerful voice that expresses a whole range of emotions. Throughout his life and career, he has gone through quite a few rough patches, but managed to get over them and learned to get professional help when needed.

Adam's sincerity and modesty are things that I highly appreciate in him. Despite his unexpected and devastating departure from 3DG and the long-lasting bitterness between Adam and Neil, they managed to work through this and bury the hatchet, which even to Adam joining the band on stage.
