Neil Sanderson is the drummer and backing vocalist, as well as songwriter of Three Days Grace.

Based on the interviews featuring him that I've seen, he's an extraverted person with a good, sometimes a bit rough, sense of humor. I share some of his views on life, regarding people's behavior, motives and issues.

In addition to drumming, he also plays piano and sings really well.
